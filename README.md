To use this tool, you need the ksdecode and wt binaries.

You can obtain ksdecode by compiling the MongoDB source code. The wt binary can also be obtained from the MongoDB source code, but it is often easier to install using a package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or APT (Debian-based systems). Alternatively, you can compile wt from the source as well.
